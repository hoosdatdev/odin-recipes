    <p> Picture this: you just got off work and ran to the gym, or picked up your littles at school or <br> 
        daycare. In the rush of getting out the door at work, you realize you forgot your afternoon <br>
        snack. Your stomach is starting to rumble and sounds above normal decibel levels start to <br>
        make your head throb. Before you try to squelch the urge to lash out at a spouse, friend or <br>
        little one you realize it’s already too late: you’re hangry. Looking for a quick meal to curb<br> 
        hanger in a flash? Shrimp couscous to the rescue! Keep reading for the recipe, and more <br>
        about how to cure hanger.</p>
 
    <p>Yes hangry: that combination of hunger and anger that destroys everything in its path until <br>
        your rumbling stomach is satisfied. If you’re human, you’ve likely been hangry before, or at <br>
        least seen someone else act out of hanger. We talk to a lot of people about food, and the <br>
        question that most often comes up is: how do I get a quick (and nutritious) meal on the <br>
        table at the end of a busy day when I’m bordering on hangry? </p>

    <p>While it’s absolutely a challenge, we’ve found that having a few resources in your arsenal <br>
        can make a huge difference. This quick shrimp couscous is one of them: it takes just 15 <br>
        minutes to make, and is seriously satisfying at that. We love creating quick and nutritious <br>
        meals to combat hanger! If you’re looking for more, check out our Easy Dinner Recipes for<br>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>

    <ul>

        <li>1 cup couscous</li>
        <li>1 ¼ teaspoon kosher salt, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 lemon</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>1 pound raw shrimp, peeled and deveined (thawed, if frozen)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons chopped parsley</li>

    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>

    <ol>
        
        <li>In a medium pot, bring 1 ¼ cups water to a boil. Add couscous and ½ teaspoon<br> 
            kosher salt. Bring to a boil, then remove from the heat, cover and let stand for 5 <br>
            minutes. When done, stir in olive oil, the juice from 1 lemon and another ¼ <br>
            teaspoon kosher salt. Taste, and add additional olive oil and lemon to taste.</li>
        <li>Mince the garlic. Pat the shrimp dry with a paper towel. In a large skillet over <br>
            medium heat, melt the butter, then add garlic and cook for 30 seconds. Increase <br>
            the heat to medium high and add the shrimp, ½ teaspoon kosher salt, and fresh <br>
            ground pepper. Cook until the shrimp are opaque, about 3 minutes, turning once.</li>
