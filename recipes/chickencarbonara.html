    <h1>Chicken Carbonara</h1>

    <p><H3>Description</H3></p>
    
    <p>When you're looking for something comforting and carb-y, nothing fits the bill like a good carbonara.
        <br> Not only is it chock full of a creamy sauce and speckled with crispy bacon, but it is a dish that's easy
        <br>to cook and you may often find that you have many of the ingredients in your kitchen already.</p>
   
        <p>This version adds a bit of protein by way of saut√©ed chicken breasts, making it the perfect quick and easy <br> 
        weeknight dinner. The key to this dish is to not skimp on the seasoning, especially on the chicken. The pepper <br>
        will toast slightly on the chicken and add a slight peppery bite that is absolutely unresistable. No fettuccine on <br>
        hand? Spaghetti, bucatini, linguine, or capellini would all be great instead. All that truly matters is that you are <br>
        able to top it off with a good dusting of freshly gratedparm. Happy slurping!</p>

    <p><h4>Ingredients</h4></p>

    <ul>

        <li>12 oz. fettuccine</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 lb. boneless skinless chicken breasts, cut into strips</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>3/4 c. freshly grated Parmesan, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>1/3 c. freshly chopped parsley, plus more for garnish</li>

    </ul>

    <p><h4>Steps</h4></p>

    <ol>
        <li>In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta according to package directions until al dente. Drain, reserving 1/2 cup pasta water, and return to pot.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon 5 minutes. Add garlic and cook until bacon is crispy, 2 to 3 minutes more. Transfer to a bowl and drain half the fat in skillet.</li>
        <li>Add chicken to skillet and increase heat to medium-high. Season generously with salt and pepper and cook, flipping halfway through, until no longer pink, 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Reduce heat to low and return bacon to skillet. Toss, then add cooked pasta and toss until combined.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl, beat together eggs, Parmesan, and parsley and season with salt and pepper.</li>
        <li>Pour egg mixture over pasta and toss until coated, then add a couple tablespoons pasta water until creamy. (Add more pasta water by the tablespoonful as necessary.)</li>
        <li>Garnish with Parmesan and parsley and serve immediately.</li>
